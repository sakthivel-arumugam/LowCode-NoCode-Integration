**Title: Technical Design for No-Code AI Workflow Integration into Existing Platform**
________________________________________
**1. Objectives and Goals**

•	Expand AI capabilities by integrating no-code development options for internal teams and business users.

•	Leverage Power Platform (Power Apps, Power Automate, AI Builder) to allow non-technical users to build AI-driven workflows.

•	Ensure seamless interaction with the existing AI platform's standardized APIs, monitoring, and feedback loops.

•	Maintain alignment with and extend capabilities of the current Document Reading Product.

**2. High-Level Architecture Overview**

**2.1 Core Components**

**•	Power Platform (No-Code Layer):** Used by business users to create workflows.

**o	Power Apps:** User interfaces for triggering document processing.

**o	Power Automate:** Automation for prediction logging, routing, and alerts.

**o	AI Builder:** For custom form processing models and classifier models.

**•	Existing AI Platform:**

o	Standardized REST APIs (Document Processing, ML Models, OpenAI services)

o	Monitoring Stack (Azure Monitor, App Insights, Azure ML monitoring)

o	Feedback pipelines (manual review data, retraining data capture, validation services)

**•	Integration Layer:**

o	Azure API Management or Logic Apps to expose/secure APIs to Power Platform

o	Azure Service Bus or Event Grid to handle event-based communication

**•	Data Layer:**

o	Azure Dataverse, Blob Storage, and/or SQL for storing predictions, validation status, feedback, and metrics

**3. Workflow & Integration Design**

**3.1 Triggering AI Workflows from Power Platform**

•	User Interaction: Business users interact with a Power Apps front-end where they upload a document or input data for analysis.

•	Workflow Trigger: Power Automate is triggered from the Power Apps action or based on events (e.g., document uploaded to SharePoint/Blob).

•	API Invocation: Power Automate sends an HTTP request to a standardized API endpoint exposed via Azure API Management.

•	Model Execution: The model (form recognizer, classifier, OpenAI prompt) processes the input and returns a prediction with metadata (e.g., confidence score, model version).

•	Output Storage: The result is stored in Dataverse or SQL tables for further tracking and review.

**3.2 Model Validation Integration**

•	Logging: Power Automate collects prediction results and formats them into a validation payload (includes model name, version, inputs, outputs, confidence).

•	Validation API Call: The formatted data is sent to the validation API endpoint (part of the existing validation pipeline).

•	Validation Logic: This service evaluates the model’s performance against predefined business rules, thresholds, or expected outputs.

o	Example: Check if confidence > 0.85 and field extraction matches known expected value.

•	Review Mechanism: If validation fails, the record is flagged. A feedback form in Power Apps can be used for manual correction.

**3.3 Monitoring Integration**

•	Telemetry Capture: Power Automate logs key metrics (execution time, model latency, prediction result, user ID, document ID) to Azure Log Analytics or Application Insights.

•	Data Aggregation: Power BI connects to Dataverse/SQL/Log Analytics for building dashboards that show:

o	Model performance over time

o	Prediction volume trends

o	Confidence score distributions

o	Error rates and manual overrides

•	Alerting: Azure Monitor or a Logic App can be configured to trigger alerts when abnormal patterns (like sudden drop in confidence scores) are detected.

**3.4 Feedback Pipeline Integration**

•	Feedback Collection: Manual reviewers interact with a Power App to correct mispredictions or provide additional context.

•	Feedback Submission: Data is logged and sent to a feedback API, contributing to the retraining dataset.

•	Closing the Loop: Once feedback is captured, it can be pushed to a data lake or retraining queue used by the ML team to improve model performance.

**4. Alignment with Document Reading Product**

•	Integrates Power Platform forms and automation for:

o	Uploading new documents

o	Selecting which AI model to use (form recognizer, classifier, OpenAI prompt)

o	Displaying and validating extracted fields

•	Output routes to the same downstream systems (validation, audit logs, feedback, retraining triggers)

•	Provides user-friendly interface for document classification and form extraction without requiring new UI development
________________________________________
**5. Key Dependencies**

•	Access to model validation pipeline (API endpoint, schema)

•	API documentation for document processing models

•	Connection configurations (Dataverse, Azure API Management, etc.)

•	Feedback data model (how corrections are logged, stored)

•	Security & compliance approvals for exposing internal APIs to Power Platform
