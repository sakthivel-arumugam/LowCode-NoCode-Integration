**1. HTTP Triggered Flows (AI → Power Automate HTTP trigger)**
**Scenario:**
- FastAPI sends an HTTP request to a Power Automate flow when a document is processed.
- Power Automate validates the document, stores metadata, and triggers further workflows.

**AI → NoCode Flow:**
- FastAPI calls https://powerautomate.com/validate-document with document details.
- Power Automate validates the document and returns a response.

**NoCode → AI Flow:**
- Power Automate calls FastAPI via an HTTP request when a document needs AI processing.
- FastAPI performs AI-based validation and returns results.

**Best For:**
✔ On-demand execution
✔ Simple API integration
✔ Fast synchronous processing

**2. Webhook Driven AI (Power Automate → AI API)**
**Scenario:**
- Power Automate sends a webhook request to FastAPI when an event occurs (e.g., new document uploaded).
- FastAPI processes the document and returns results asynchronously.

**AI → NoCode Flow:**
- FastAPI registers a webhook URL in Power Automate.
- When AI processing is complete, FastAPI sends a webhook notification to Power Automate.

**NoCode → AI Flow:**
- Power Automate triggers a webhook to FastAPI when a document is uploaded.
- FastAPI processes the document and sends results back.

**Best For:**
✔ Event-driven workflows
✔ Real-time AI processing
✔ Decoupled architecture

**3. Middleware Functions (Enrich, Authenticate, Route)**
**Scenario:**
- A middleware function sits between FastAPI and Power Automate to handle authentication, logging, and data enrichment.
- Middleware validates requests, adds metadata, and routes them to the correct workflow.

**AI → NoCode Flow:**
- FastAPI sends a request to middleware before reaching Power Automate.
- Middleware adds metadata, authenticates, and routes the request.

**NoCode → AI Flow:**
- Power Automate sends requests to middleware before reaching FastAPI.
- Middleware validates API keys, enriches data, and forwards the request.

**Best For:**
✔ Security & authentication
✔ Data transformation
✔ Centralized request handling

**4. Asynchronous Queues (Service Bus for Long-Running Tasks)**
**Scenario:**
- FastAPI sends tasks to Azure Service Bus for long-running document processing.
- Power Automate listens to the queue and processes tasks asynchronously.

**AI → NoCode Flow:**
- FastAPI sends a message to Azure Service Bus when a document needs validation.
- Power Automate picks up the message and triggers validation workflows.

**NoCode → AI Flow:**
- Power Automate sends a message to Azure Service Bus when AI processing is required.
- FastAPI retrieves the message and processes the document.

**Best For:**
✔ Handling large workloads
✔ Ensuring message durability
✔ Decoupling services

**5. Custom Connectors (Native Drag-and-Drop Actions in NoCode)**
**Scenario:**
- A custom connector allows Power Automate users to interact with FastAPI without writing code.
- Users can drag-and-drop actions like "Validate Document" or "Get AI Feedback."

**AI → NoCode Flow:**
- FastAPI exposes API endpoints via a custom connector.
- Power Automate calls FastAPI actions using drag-and-drop workflows.

**NoCode → AI Flow:**
- Power Automate provides a UI for business users to trigger AI workflows.
- FastAPI processes requests and returns results.

**Best For:**
✔ Business user accessibility
✔ Standardized API interactions
✔ Reusable workflows

Which Approach Should You Use?
- If real-time execution, go with HTTP-triggered flows or webhooks.
- If structured API calls, use custom connectors.
- If long-running tasks, Azure Service Bus is ideal.
- If security and routing, middleware functions help.
